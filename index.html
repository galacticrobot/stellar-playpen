                <img src="img/surfer.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; max-width: 300px; margin-left: 20px;">
                <p><span class="first-letter">J</span>ohn H. "Doc" Ball, at age 94, was the oldest living American surfer when he passed away in December of 2001. Throughout his final years, he continued to skateboard and surf without a wetsuit in Shelter Cove in Northern California.</p>
                <p>Doc had been riding waves since 1929 and wrote the classic photo book about early California surfing, CALIFORNIA SURFRIDERS (1946). A dentist and perhaps the best-known surf photographer who ever lived, he captured more classic surf images from the 1930s through the '50s than any other photographer. He co-founded the State's first surf club in Palos Verdes, was a great storyteller, a legend among surfers (and surf photographers) and a warm and generous spirit, who remained "stoked" about life until his final days.</p>
                <p>In addition to loving the ocean's waves, he loved the camaraderie of surfing, beachcombing and gathering driftwood to carve. His woodcarving speciality was eagles. As the partriarch of American surfers, he opens and closes SURFING FOR LIFE. His ashes were spread at sea in dual memorials at both Shelter Cove and Palos Verdes Cove. Doc is survived by his wife, Evelyn and son Norm.</p>

                ps. The guy in the photo has nothing to do with the text. Found them both with a google search. d.s

                <h2>My Grandparents wedding</h2>
                <p><span class="first-letter">I</span> feel very fortunate to have known my grandparents on both sides as I grew up. They are close to my heart and mind, even though they have gone to the other side of the veil. I cannot thank them enough for the kindness and love they have shown me.</p>
                <p>I would like to share a few of the things I admire about my grandparents and what it has taught me.</p>

                <p>My father's parents have a special place in my heart. They lived in Utah, in a small home, where they raised four sons and one daughter. My parents moved about an hour away from my grandparents when I was only four years old, but we made trips to visit with them every month. I remember well their porch swing and the beautiful flower garden. My grandpa worked very hard on his farm raising sheep, chickens and growing a vegetable garden. He also attended college and got a teaching degree. He taught woodworking and metals, and made some very beautiful things with his hands. Grandpa Hugh was a great example and a loving grandfather.</p>
                <p>My paternal grandmother was a small lady with a big heart. She baked some of the tastiest lamb, bread, and cakes ever. She preserved the fruits and vegetables they grew by canning them each summer. I especially loved her pickled beets. She also made yummy jams and jellies. She could serve up a bounteous Thanksgiving feast for all of us. She loved music and had an organ in her home. Grandma Gladys had a wonderful alto voice and I am also an alto. She also loved art and took art classes at a university. I have one of her pastel paintings in my home.</p>

                <h2>I was converted to bicycle commuting about a year and a half ago</h2>
                <p><span class="first-letter">I</span>’ve always thought people who bicycle were pretty awesome, it had just never occurred to me that maybe I could do it too, as silly as that is. So when I started making new friends that were what I considered hardcore cyclists, I figured I’d make like a sheep and join the herd.</p>

                <p>Now, I live in a small, small town, and I’m a little over a mile always from the college (yep, still a student), so I had the wonderful opportunity to slowly ease my way into biking, well, everywhere: to the grocery store, to restaurants, to the bar, to the bank. It’s incredibly liberating to be able to get myself places expediently without having to pay for gas.</p>

                <p>I graduate soon and go to the real world, and one of the things I’m afraid of is loosing touch with my bicycle.</p>

                <p>I don’t know what size city I’ll end up in, and it’s likely that the grocery store is going to be a bit more than half a mile away. I really don’t want to end up driving everywhere just because everything is so much farther away.</p>

                <p>So, I decided to make a list of the reasons I love bicycling to remind myself when I’m somewhere new and trying to motivate myself to start making longer commutes in who knows what kind of weather.</p>

                    <h2>Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan </h2>
                    <p><span class="first-letter">K</span>azakh television personality Borat Sagdiyev leaves Kazakhstan for the "Greatest Country in the World", the "U, S and A" to make a documentary at the behest of the Kazakh Ministry of Information. He leaves behind his wife Oksana and other inhabitants of his village including his "43-year-old" mother, "No. 4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan" sister, "the town rapist", "the town mechanic and abortionist", bringing along his producer Azamat Bagatov and a pet chicken.</p>

                    <p>In New York, Borat sees an episode of Baywatch on television and immediately falls in love with Pamela Anderson. While interviewing and mocking a panel of feminists, he learns her name and her residence in California. Borat is then informed by telegram that his wife has been killed by a bear. Delighted, he secretly resolves to make Anderson his new wife in California; Azamat is told they are going to California because "Pearl Harbor is there. So is Texas." Azamat is afraid of flying because of the September 11, 2001 attacks, which he believes were the work of Jews. Borat, therefore, takes driving lessons and buys a dilapidated Gaz truck for the journey.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="secondary">
                   <p>During the trip, Borat acquires a Baywatch booklet at a yard sale and continues gathering footage for his documentary. He meets gay pride parade participants, politicians Alan Keyes and Bob Barr and African American youths. Borat is also interviewed on live television and disrupts the weather report. Visiting a rodeo, Borat excites the crowd with jingoistic American remarks, but then sings a fictional Kazakhstani national anthem to the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner", receiving a strong negative reaction. Staying at a bed-and-breakfast, Borat and Azamat are stunned to learn their hosts are Jewish. Fearful at the hands of their hosts, the two escape after throwing money toward cockroaches, believing they are their Jewish hosts transformed. While Azamat advises a return to New York, Borat attempts to buy a handgun to defend himself against Jews. When told he cannot buy a gun because he is not an American citizen, Borat purchases a bear for protection.</p>
